.. title:: Using turtleFSI

.. _getting_started:

===============
Using turtleFSI
===============

turtleFSI is a ... TODO

The goal of turtleFSI is to ... TODO

However, 

The numerical schemes in turtleFSI is presented and tested in Slyngstad [1]_ and Gjertsen [2]_.

The input problem set up for the TF_cfd, TF_csm, and TF_fsi is taken from the Turek et al. [3]_ benchmark
paper.

We would like to acknowledge the open-source project `FEniCS <https://www.fenicsproject.org>`_,
with is the basis of turtleFSI.


Tutorials
=========
For turtleFSI to be user friendly, we provide a tutorial on you can create your own problem file.

If you have any questions beyond the tutorials, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.


New features
============
The existing methods provide many degrees of freedom, however, if you need a specific method
or functionality, please do not hesitate to propose enhancements in the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/KVSlab/turtleFSI/issues/>`_, or create a pull request with new features.
Our only request is that you follow our
`guidelines for contributing <https://github.com/KVSlab/turtleFSI/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
